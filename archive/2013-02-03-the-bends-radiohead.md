“The Bends”: slang for the sickness suffered by divers when sudden
decompression causes nitrogen bubbles to form in the body’s tissues,
resulting in pain, weakness, and sometimes death.

Everyone knows the story of this album. Radiohead blew up with their
single “Creep”, and their success had a catastrophic effect on Thom
Yorke, who thought the whole thing was shit. Can you blame him?

I think they’re better for it, because it caused them to write a killer
record. 1995’s The Bends is one of the most solid front-to-back records
I know. Really, if you can find filler on this record, I’d love to hear
about it.

From “My Iron Lung”, to “Fake Plastic Trees”; to “Bones” and “Just”, and
then what I firmly believe are the best three ending tracks of any
album, ever, this one just does it right.

This whole disc is one big “fuck you.” And it’s exactly what Radiohead
needed.

Sounds like: “we’re not going anywhere.”
