title: Doppelgänger - The Fall of Troy

The Fall of Troy’s 2005 banger “Doppelgänger” is a trio of 18 year old
telling you that they know how to rock harder than you.

Everyone who played Guitar Hero knows F.C.P.R.E.M.I.X., but not everyone
knows that the rest of this collection is just as good. In fact, some
are better: I love “I Just Got This Symphony Goin’”, while “‘You Got A
Death Wish, Johnny Truant?’” is an amazingly tough 2:13.

“The Hol[ ]y Tape…” has a jumpy, shreddy chorus for the ages, and one of
the whackier bridges ever, that evokes RHCP’s One Hot Minute album.

Get your shit together and put down the James Taylor records for five
minutes, you might like Doppelgänger.

Sounds like: riffs like nails, drums likes a blender
