title: Song Review - Hello - Martin Solveig featuring Dragonette

This song touches me on a level that it probably shouldn’t.

The time I spent Down Under happened to be the 1st semester of the
Australian academic year. Australians being who/what/why they are, I and
the other Americans at the College were classified as “freshers”
(freshmen), despite all of us being 21 years old.

This was obviously for purposes of initiation. I’ll leave the hazing
details for myself and my notebook, but let’s just say living in
Australia for 5 months gave me more of an insight into
fraternity/sorority psychology than I bargained for.

Among many other College traditions, there was a song dedicated to each
fresher class. “Hello” by Martin Solveig was ours. I must say, it was a
damn good pick.

The people acting as the “rush chairs” (in everything but name, I assure
you) would, at almost every all-college social occasion, manage to graft
this song onto whatever stereo and playlist happened to be in house, and
perform a certain hilarious dance, with many such topical enhancements
as motorboating and copious thrusting.

The highlight for me was to see, as the music usually obscured the
vernacular, the President of the College walk among dancers and on cue
recite — in his best imitation of the College Warden chastising a group
of College women he caught streaking — the phrase, “16th century sluts!”
Does it get any better than that?

Sounds like: boxed wine, humidity, spiders with their own lawn chairs,
short shorts.
