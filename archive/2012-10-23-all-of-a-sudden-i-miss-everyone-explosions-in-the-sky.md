title: All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone - Explosions in the Sky
created: 2012-10-23

I had the distinct privilege to see Explosions in the Sky live at Austin
City Limits in 2006. ACL that year was pretty killer. I saw Van
Morrison, Massive Attack, John Mayer, The Raconteurs, Gnarls Barkley
(yep), Nickel Creek, Guster, Gomez (I definitely forgot to add their
disc to the list, maybe they’ll get a special guest review or
something), Wolf Parade, The Long Winters, TV on the Radio and many
great others. 

Explosions was pretty wild though, and they’ve been a favorite ever
since. They lead me to Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor so that’s
pretty neat
([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs)).

Explosions’ “The Rescue” and “How Strange, Innocence” are excellent and
stand well on their own. I have to say that “The Earth Is Not A Cold
Dead Place” and this joint are the hot stuff, though. They’re in a
league of their own. The titles of the tracks dovetail well with the
song-matter: “The Birth and Death of Day”, “What Do You Go Home To?”,
and my absolute favorite, “So Long, Lonesome”. 

This album is many things. It is bike rides. It is Sunday smiles in bed.
It is breakup tears. It is rainstorms. It is late nights chatter and
sober-up cigarettes. And I love it. 

Sounds like: Bittersweet.
