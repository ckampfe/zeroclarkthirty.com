title: One Hot Minute - Red Hot Chili Peppers

One Hot Minute is in the unfortunate position of both being critically
panned and publicly unknown. This reputation is entirely unjust and
rests, I think, on the fact that Dave Navarro was the one-off guitarist,
making the whole experience…weird.

“Aeroplane” is the one palatable single that — amazingly! — still makes
radio play some 18 years later. In the balance, this is redeeming,
because it’s a damn great song.

In the scheme of Chili Peppers albums, this one comes from a darker
place. This isn’t the Freaky Styley happy-party-funk, and it isn’t the
sex-romp of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It sounds more like relapse and
tragedy. It’s sentimental and its fucked up.

Sounds like: tears, psychedelic guitar wails
