Grasshopper Takeover was a band I was never into while they were
actually a band. Strange, because they are from my hometown and played
shows miles from where I lived.

Elephant Dreams is a warm, down-home pop-rock showcase. This is the
music you could imagine playing with your friends in your basement. Just
a couple of guys getting together and rocking.

There are hints of folk, hints of The Band, and the arrangements are
generally pretty unassuming. It all makes for a refreshingly honestly
listen. No crazy production, no angst-ridden vocals. “Esta Vida” and
“Money Back” and “Emily Rose” are fun jangly pop-rock joints, and I like
them.

Sounds like: Nebraska
