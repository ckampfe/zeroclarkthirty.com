The last day of a hellish month.

It's weird to witness something historical in real time. You think it'll be energizing or awe-inspiring, but mostly it's equal measures dull, foreboding, and helplessness-inducing. More than 4,000 people have died, which seems at once so many and so little. We haven't seen the worst of it. So many more will die. The Trump administration estimates more than 100,000.

Who are we, that treat essential workers like delivery drivers and warehouse pickers and nurses with such disrespect?
Who are we, that deny healthcare to those unable to convince someone to give them a salary?
Who are we, that demand a nation where more than 3.5 million filed for unemployment benefits continue to pay rent to landlords?
Who are we, who mocked this as the flu?
Who are we, who let this happen?
