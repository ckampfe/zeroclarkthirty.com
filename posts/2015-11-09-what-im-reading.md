[RECONSIDER - DHH](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3972-reconsider)

1. "Angels? Really? You've plucked your self-serving moniker from the parables of a religion that specifically and explicitly had its head honcho throw the money men out of the temple and proclaim a rich man less likely to make it into heaven than a camel through a needle's eye."

2. "&#x2026;on Twitter, people say things that they think of as ephemeral and chatty. Their utterances are then treated as unequivocal political statements by people outside the conversation."

3. "'Now, it's just Twitter. It's a space where all contexts are collapsed and all ideas can be mob-amplified or end up pulled for a Buzzfeed article.'"

[Executing Software Engineers for Bugs - Harlan Lieberman-Berg](https://blog.setec.io/2015/11/01/ethics.html)

1. "Do we, as software engineers, have the same kind of moral responsibility as our fellow engineers in other disciplines?

3. "Computing has become infrastructure, but it doesn't work like infrastructure."
