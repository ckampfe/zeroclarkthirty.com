- There are [more COVID-19 cases in the United States than anywhere else](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/coronavirus-news.html#link-8bbde61), with NYT reporting at least 81,321 confirmed infections. There are, doubtless, more.
- [More than 1,000 people have died of COVID-19 in New York.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html)
- Trump extended social distancing guidelines until at least the end of April.
- Chicago remains locked down until at least April 7. I went for a long bike ride yesterday, and the city is changed completely. Traffic is almost nonexistent, hardly anyone is out walking, parks are empty. It appears people are following the recommendations from what I am seeing, but we have not yet seen the worst of this thing here. Simulations are showing that we will see the worst of it some time around April 13.
- [Liberty University has decided to remain open](https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-it-like-on-one-of-the-only-university-campuses-still-open-in-the-us) despite all prevailing evidence.
- [Instacart shoppers will strike for better working conditions](https://6abc.com/amp/instacart-strike-coronavirus-covid-19/6060570/) including hazard pay.
