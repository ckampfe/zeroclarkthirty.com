title: LLMs are a deal with The Devil

The Devil comes to you and offers you a deal.

You will receive a magic machine that can at your direction, write stories, draw pictures, make music, plan a project, research, program a computer, solve a math problem, translate a foreign language. All he wants is your ability to learn and master these things on your own. 

"If you have this machine," he says, "what need do you have for these abilities? They would only be a burden. The machine can perform them far better than you can! Think of the suffering of learning all of these skills on your own! Think of the toil! Think of all the mistakes you'll make! Think of the embarassement!"

This is the deal LLMs offer.

LLMs offer the gift of the atrophied muscle, the senile brain, the unopened book, the love note never written, the garden never planted, the knee unscraped, the adventure never taken.

This is no gift, this is no deal!

This is the desire to be flattened, destroyed, to give up one's self, to be a slave, to have your decisions made for you. Don't do it!
