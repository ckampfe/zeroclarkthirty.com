1. "That's the real crime being perpetrated by the reputation culture: stamping out passion; stamping out the individual."

2. "Today, he would’ve been 29. Use your time wisely. May you have more time than him, and may you use it as wisely as he did."

1. "If I were to sign it now, I'd be committing forgery. I’d be putting my 1943 signature on a canvas painted in 1922. No, I cannot sign it, madam, I'm sorry."

2. "And the name a person bears or adopts has its importance."

3. "That was a good idea of yours to chop up the female body that way. The details are always exciting."

4. "Venus is replaced by the Virgin, but the same life goes on."

1. "Bad behavior arises when you abstract people away from the consequences of their actions."
