title: Things to keep in mind
created: 2013-12-25

- More patience, less frustration: with code, learning, tools
- More work, less jealousy: of people I should be learning from
- More empathy, less judgement: of those I should be helping and loving
- More forgiveness, less anger: at my own and others' shortcomings
- Remembering and rediscovering: who I am, what I believe in, and why
