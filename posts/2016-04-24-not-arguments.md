## "you can write shitty code in any language"

## "it's about tradeoffs"

## "the best tool for the job"

## "you just aren't doing $PROCESS right"

Programming is the manipulation of symbolic language.
Other professions share this purpose &#x2013; law and journalism among them &#x2013; with
varying emphasis on the "symbolic". Programmers use computers as our vehicle,
which makes us so special we've given ourselves pass to perpetrate
language genocide in our debates and and on our mailing lists.

Attempting to inject nuance into every damn thing services no one, and instead
comes across as obfuscatory ass-covering, hedging against any potential
refutation.

The above phrases are not arguments. They do not mean anything. They do not make
you sound smarter. Stop using them.
