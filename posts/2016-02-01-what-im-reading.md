[Making Peace With Violence: Camus in Algeria - Robert Zaretsky](http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/opinionator/2016/01/22/making-peace-with-violence/)

1. "Camus would immediately recognize the Islamic State as an enemy as loathsome and nihilistic as Nazism, and one that we must combat with violence. But at the same time, he would warn us not to lose recognition of who we are and why we are fighting."

2. "For Camus, true rebellion entails great tension. It holds fast to the moral center, resisting those who seek to oppress oneself all the while resisting one's own tendency to oppress in turn."

[Ricky Gervais does not get enough credit for being offensive - Grace Dent](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/ricky-gervais-does-not-get-enough-credit-for-being-offensive-a6806461.html)

1. "'Better get dressed and offend some humourless cunts I suppose,' Gervais tweeted before donning his suit for the ceremony. I was one of these humourless cunts once, I thought."

2. "Possibly the only thing the internet relishes more than being offended – wringing the jollity out of one-liners, demanding comedians apologise – is being bereaved."

3. "None of us, not even celebrities, has the right to sail through life unoffended."

[As Zika virus spreads, El Salvador asks women not to get pregnant until 2018 - Joshua Partlow](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/as-zika-virus-spreads-el-salvador-asks-women-not-to-get-pregnant-until-2018/2016/01/22/1dc2dadc-c11f-11e5-98c8-7fab78677d51_story.html?tid%3Dpm_world_pop_b)

1. "'Morality says that people shouldn't have that control' over procreation, Figueroa said. 'But the church also isn't going to say something that runs contrary to life and health.'"

[The Unintentional side-effects of a bad concurrency model - Joe Armstrong](https://joearms.github.io/2016/01/26/The-Unintentional-Side-Effects-of-a-Bad-Concurrency-Model.html)

1. "I was initially confused when I learned about the software architecture of the AXE system since it appeared to be very similar to the organizational structure of a large part of the company."

2. "Concurrency has been forgotten in most programming languages, and when it has been added it seems like a afterthought, not as an act of conscious design."

3. "Concentrating on the communication provides a higher level of abstraction than concentrating on the function APIs used within the system."

[Dorothea Lange: The Internment of Japanese American Citizens - ASX](http://www.americansuburbx.com/2016/01/dorothea-lange-japanese-internment.html)

1. "'This is what we did. How did it happen? How could we?'"

[Debt Dodgers: Meet the Americans Who Moved to Europe and Went AWOL on Their Student Loans - Alexander Coggin](https://www.vice.com/read/talking-to-american-debt-dodgers-who-moved-to-europe-to-avoid-paying-off-their-student-loans-111)

1. "The amount of money adults in the US owe due to educations is over $1.3 trillion and jumps up by more than $2,000 every second."

2. "Sure, I realize the responsibility I took on when I signed the papers and agreed to take out the loans, but I should have never had to do it in the first place. I feel some sort of civic duty not to pay them back, as if my small protest will make any kind of difference."

3. "Our mentors and teachers told us that we would pay this education off for a long time, but everyone in America is doing it so it's almost like eating breakfast. That's how Americans are raised."

4. Thanks to Brandon Hirdler for the article

[Erlang Question mailing list: Why Erlang looks like it does - Robert Virding](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2015-December/087223.html)

1. "Again our goal was to solve the problem, not design a language with a predefined set of primitives."

2. "Everything was very problem oriented and we did not have as goals that Erlang should be a functional language or that we should implement the actor model."

3. "IMAO one reason that Erlang/OTP has taken a long time to become adopted is that in many cases it took designers of these other systems a long to realise that they actually did have these requirements and that Erlang was a good way of meeting them."

[Ian Murdock In His Own Words: What Made Debian Such A Community Project - Gabriella Coleman](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160112/16582733316/ian-murdock-his-own-words-what-made-debian-such-community-project.shtml)

1. "'And my final test as to whether or not Debian succeeded was: could the founder step away from the project and could the project keep going because that is the only point at which you know that the project has basically taken a life of its own.'"

[Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily­formulated ideas - Marvin Minsky](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/Why%2520programming%2520is--.html)

1. "A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible."

2. "To begin, I want to warn against the pitfall of accepting the apparently 'moderate' positions taken by many people who believe they understand the situation."
