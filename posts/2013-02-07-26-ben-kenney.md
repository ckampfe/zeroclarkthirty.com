title: Forget What You Know - Midtown

What to say. Ben Kenney has been something of an inspiration for me. The
guy has created what now - 4? 5? 6? - awesome albums, largely by
himself, and mostly before middle age.

As I said in my review of Maduro (LINK), he plays all of the instruments
and sings all of vocals. It’s a display of willpower and work ethic. I
think would be one thing if Maduro and 26 were just OK, but they’re not.

They’re fucking great. I heard them first in high school, from Calvin
(that name keeps appearing), and I still give them spins to this very
day.

Inspiration makes climbing the hills shorter and the summits more
beautiful.

Sounds like: one man and his hammer.
