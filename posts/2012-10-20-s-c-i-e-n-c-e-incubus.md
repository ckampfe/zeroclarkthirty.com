title: S.C.I.E.N.C.E. - Incubus

Some albums are good for a relaxing listen. This is not one of those.
Incubus’ S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is a fucking trip. And a trip it genuinely is,
because Incubus was getting to know the finer properties of psilocybin
mushrooms (and other delicacies) before, during and after the production
of this album.

In a long line of records starting at the beginning of high school and
ending in a Bill Hicksian drug philosophy, this one is among the
earliest.

Some might try to paint this album into the Limp Bizkit or early
Zebrahead corner, but there’s more than that. There’s a bit of DJ Shadow
here, there’s a bit of Massive Attack here. You know how you can hear
the drugs when you listen to a Beatles record? Yeah. It’s that, but
louder.

This album also has my favorite “drive fast” song of all time, “New
Skin”. 

Sounds like: that trip where you meet aliens.
