[The Lisp Curse - Rudolf Winestock](http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html)

1. "The moral of this story is that secondary and tertiary effects matter. Technology not only affects what we can do with respect to technological issues, it also affects our social behavior. This social behavior can loop back and affect the original technological issues under consideration."

2. "Since making Scheme object-oriented is so easy, many Scheme hackers have done so. More to the point, many individual Scheme hackers have done so."

[Fail at Scale & Controlling Queue Delay - Adrian Colyer](http://blog.acolyer.org/2015/11/19/fail-at-scale-controlling-queue-delay/)

1. "Good queues convert bursty arrivals into smooth, steady departures (and reduce in length when the arrival rate drops back down below the departure rate). Bad queues (standing queues) serve no useful purpose and simply create excess delay."
