This is a bit of a catch up post, since my last one was [in 2021](https://zeroclarkthirty.com/2021-01-19-potus-notes).

Donald Trump is again the president, defeating Kamala Harris in the 2024 election by more than 2 million votes.

Over the weekend, in response to protests against ICE immigration raids in Los Angeles, Trump has federalized the California National Guard and deployed Marines. So far it seems like injuries have been minimal. Protests have spread around the country but so far are small.

Inflation has moderated some, but remains higher than before the pandemic.

Trump instituted a haphazard tariff policy that briefly crashed the stock markets before they recovered above their previous positions.

Trump accepted the gift of a new Air Force One from the country of Qatar.

He is also working to pass a tax bill that adds to the budget deficit and mainly cuts taxes on high income earners.
