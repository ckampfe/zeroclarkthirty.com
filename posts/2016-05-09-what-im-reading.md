1. "I love words. I love my dictionaries. I literally love what I am doing. And there is this feeling of having a mission. I cherish the thought that we supply something that has not been done."

[Exploring the Wasteland with Fine Artist V Holeček - Elizabeth Hobson](http://triggerwarning.us/exploring-the-wasteland-with-fine-artist-v-holecek/)

1. "They all want a lot of the same things; which is to be able to tell you what you're allowed to say, do, or enjoy. The person who wants to rule the world and the person who wants to save it are all too often one-in-the-same."

2. "They're not buying what they think will go with the drapes. They are all over the board. This has taught me never to presume too much about a person."

[The Fall of Hacker Groups - Strauss](http://phrack.org/issues/69/6.html#article)

1. "We are tormented by a relentless flow of information as well as the daily worries of an eternally insecure, unwarranted life. Furthermore, we dread the thought of being alike, of sharing multiple views and opinions. As such, we are turning progressively judgemental of who we should be partnering with, on the basis that 'they do not understand'."

2. "Communities, rather than individuals, should be more intellectually empowered to create, but lately we have been watching the force of the solo, the age of the ego."
