On Thursday I got the chance to speak with two excellent gentlemen in the software
community: [Ashish Dixit](http://about.me/tundal45) and [Corey
Haines](http://www.coreyhaines.com/).

We were at Dev Bootcamp to hear Ashish recount his experience and wisdom learned
in the process of becoming a junior developer at Groupon. For the DBC crowd, it
was illuminating to hear the strategies used by someone (relatively) closer to
our own level of experience.

Afterword, I introduced myself to Corey and Ashish and the three of us
continued along the lines of Ashish's talk.  My takeaway from that conversation
has been that I need to focus down to one or two key genres/areas/technologies
and work to get *good* at those things specifically.

I'm anxious about this realization, especially in the concrete form as put by
Corey and Ashish. There are so many things that I want to learn, such that I feel torn
as to which I will want to be doing for the next N months or years.

My limited knowledge touches mainly on the Ruby and JavaScript worlds, and I love
them both.

Which technology -- and more importantly: which community -- is worth sinking my
limited cycles into?
