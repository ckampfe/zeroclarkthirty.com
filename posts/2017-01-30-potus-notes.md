- Donald Trump [fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-immigration-executive-order-234401) after she directed Department of Justice lawyers not to defend Trump's executive order barring immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries.
- [The White House statement](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/01/30/read-full-white-house-statement-sally-yates/HkFReIYJidU9deDelPK6SM/story.html) announcing her dismissal claims she "betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States."
- Trump replacement [Dana J. Boente](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html) immediately reversed Ms Yates' directive.
