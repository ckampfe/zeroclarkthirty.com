I love the shit out this album. Maybe it’s the quotes from Terrence
Malick’s “The Thin Red Line” at the outset that do me. As a general
rule, if it involves Terrence Malick, I’m voting “aye”.

When I listen to Never, Never, Land I usually feel something between
dread and melancholy. It’s the sort of feeling one gets when pondering
the human capacity for evil. And you know what? That’s OK. We need to
feel dread and melancholy every once in a while.


Sounds like: a dark film condensed to the speed of music.
