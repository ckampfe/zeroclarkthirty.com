Well, here’s an undertaking. I present to you a list of 84 albums that
I, at one time or another in the past or present, have found special.
This is a retrospective that createds back to my days in middle school, so
it covers roughly ten years of my life.

Maybe I’ll give a few a full review, maybe I’ll write a few lines about
some, and maybe I’ll post selected tracks for others. Who knows.

(The criteria for selection is in the nebulous/emotional range, nothing
more. I’m not Pitchfork.)

[Here they are](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArDppihwaWa6dFdaeV9pOXNTeERqbWVFTFp5bWFuNmc&output=html)

I’ll upcreated this post to indicate the order of review.
