[Why do we work so hard? - Ryan Avent](https://www.1843magazine.com/features/why-do-we-work-so-hard)

1. "The problem is not that overworked professionals are all miserable. The problem is that they are not."

2. "One of the facts of modern life is that a relatively small class of people works very long hours and earns good money for its efforts."

3. "Willingly or unwillingly, those lower down the ladder worked fewer and fewer hours. Those at the top, meanwhile, worked longer and longer."

4. "At the end of the day we can sit back and admire our work – the completed article, the sealed deal, the functioning app – in the way that artisans once did, and those earning a middling wage in the sprawling service-sector no longer do."

5. Thanks to Brandon Hirdler for the article

[Boot: Build it like a Pro(grammer)! - Anatoly Polinsky](https://gist.github.com/tolitius/284c156e2dec4155d3f6)

1. "Boot tasks are functions. boot.build is Clojure code. Customizing/fixing/understanding a task is no different than doing it for any other Clojure library. There is no mental gap of decyphering someone's DSL."
