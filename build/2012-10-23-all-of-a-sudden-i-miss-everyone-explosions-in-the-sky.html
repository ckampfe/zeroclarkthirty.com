            <h2>All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone - Explosions in the Sky</h2>
<p class="meta">2012-10-23</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>I had the distinct privilege to see Explosions in the Sky live at Austin
City Limits in 2006. ACL that year was pretty killer. I saw Van
Morrison, Massive Attack, John Mayer, The Raconteurs, Gnarls Barkley
(yep), Nickel Creek, Guster, Gomez (I definitely forgot to add their
disc to the list, maybe they’ll get a special guest review or
something), Wolf Parade, The Long Winters, TV on the Radio and many
great others. </p>
<p>Explosions was pretty wild though, and they’ve been a favorite ever
since. They lead me to Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor so that’s
pretty neat
(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs</a></a>).</p>
<p>Explosions’ “The Rescue” and “How Strange, Innocence” are excellent and
stand well on their own. I have to say that “The Earth Is Not A Cold
Dead Place” and this joint are the hot stuff, though. They’re in a
league of their own. The titles of the tracks dovetail well with the
song-matter: “The Birth and Death of Day”, “What Do You Go Home To?”,
and my absolute favorite, “So Long, Lonesome”. </p>
<p>This album is many things. It is bike rides. It is Sunday smiles in bed.
It is breakup tears. It is rainstorms. It is late nights chatter and
sober-up cigarettes. And I love it. </p>
<p>Sounds like: Bittersweet.</p>
