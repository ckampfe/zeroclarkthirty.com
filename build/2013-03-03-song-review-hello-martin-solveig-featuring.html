            <h2>Song Review - Hello - Martin Solveig featuring Dragonette</h2>
<p class="meta">2013-03-07</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>This song touches me on a level that it probably shouldn’t.</p>
<p>The time I spent Down Under happened to be the 1st semester of the
Australian academic year. Australians being who/what/why they are, I and
the other Americans at the College were classified as “freshers”
(freshmen), despite all of us being 21 years old.</p>
<p>This was obviously for purposes of initiation. I’ll leave the hazing
details for myself and my notebook, but let’s just say living in
Australia for 5 months gave me more of an insight into
fraternity/sorority psychology than I bargained for.</p>
<p>Among many other College traditions, there was a song dedicated to each
fresher class. “Hello” by Martin Solveig was ours. I must say, it was a
damn good pick.</p>
<p>The people acting as the “rush chairs” (in everything but name, I assure
you) would, at almost every all-college social occasion, manage to graft
this song onto whatever stereo and playlist happened to be in house, and
perform a certain hilarious dance, with many such topical enhancements
as motorboating and copious thrusting.</p>
<p>The highlight for me was to see, as the music usually obscured the
vernacular, the President of the College walk among dancers and on cue
recite — in his best imitation of the College Warden chastising a group
of College women he caught streaking — the phrase, “16th century sluts!”
Does it get any better than that?</p>
<p>Sounds like: boxed wine, humidity, spiders with their own lawn chairs,
short shorts.</p>
