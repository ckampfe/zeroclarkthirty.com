            <h2>Tragic Kingdom - No Doubt</h2>
<p class="meta">2013-02-13</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>If you didn’t fall in love with Age of Empires II at one point, you are
a chump. There, I said it.</p>
<p>“Choppa”. (I preferred the Britons)</p>
<p>How the hell does No Doubt’s 1995 “Tragic Kingdom” relate to Age of
Empires II, you ask?</p>
<p>It’s simple. When playing a cracked, disk-image version of AoEII on my
parents old Windows ME (yes, I know) machine, the game would still spin
up whatever disc happened to be in the CD-ROM drive at the time. In a
true testament to childhood laziness, “Tragic Kingdom” was that disc for
a good number of weeks or months.</p>
<p>I heard “Excuse Me Mr.” blast into its first bars thousands of times.</p>
<p>An interesting tidbit: my brother and I both played songs from this
album at our high school’s Winter Formal half-time show Battle of the
Bands. His band played “Different People” and mine played “Sunday
Morning”. I think his performance was better.</p>
<p>This album has gone on to be a classic for just about everyone who ever
heard it, and it’s easy to see why. This was Gwen at her best. This was
third-wave ska, if not at its finest, at least in its most pure,
idiomatic form. Other names from this time period pleasantly spring to
mind: <a href="http://bit.ly/WYvbuP">Goldfinger</a>.
<a href="http://bit.ly/X13jTu">Fishbone</a>. <a href="http://bit.ly/XA1Gxk">Sublime</a>. <a href="http://bit.ly/WYtSvV">The
Mighty Mighty Bosstones</a>. <a href="http://bit.ly/14MpwtS">The Dance Hall
Crashers</a>. <a href="http://bit.ly/12EOlcU">Reel Big
Fish</a>. <a href="http://bit.ly/154ylQV">Less Than Jake</a>.</p>
<p>All things considered, not a bad bug for a cracked copy of a game, I’d
say.</p>
<p>Sounds like: 90s.</p>
