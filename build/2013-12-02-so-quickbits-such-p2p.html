            <h2>So Quickbits. Such p2p.</h2>

<div class="post">
  <p>I have, for as long as I can remember, been unable to separate my experience
as a person using the internet from the ethical considerations that come along
with that experience.</p>
<p>When I was a little kid, I hated when my parents would force me off the internet.
Of course I was doing things like creating Expages sites and finding the best
online game sites (Flash and Java applets in those days…remember?), but I was
also doing something more. I was becoming experienced. I was learning to navigate a
community larger than a town or country: its customs, its slang, its
expectations, its pitfalls, and what makes it great.</p>
<p>It was the internet, and to this day it continues to draw me in with the honesty
of its promise. The internet is not only freedom from, it is also the freedom
<strong>to</strong>.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the reason why I have never and will (likely) never be able to
identify as politically conservative: the freedom to do something (positive
freedom) is such a better way to conceptualize human action than the freedom
from interference (negative freedom).</p>
<p>From the start, I conceived of <a href="http://quickbits.co">Quickbits</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Surram/quickbits">fork at github</a>)
as a service that a few DBC devs-in-training could offer to show their commitment
to user freedom while picking up some useful skills in our final project. The
pitch itself sprung as the melding of a few ideas a fellow boot of mine had
(anonymous location-based mobile chat) with my desire to explore the world of
<a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> while taking a crack at <a href="http://xkcd.com/949/">a longstanding
problem</a>.</p>
<p>Our group ran into conflict this weekend while considering whether or not
collecting user information was within project scope when the project happens to
be an anonymous, peer-to-peer/browser-to-browser file sharing application.</p>
<p>It is a discussion for which I am glad to have been at least a partial progenitor and
contributor. I am proud to be among a group of developers willing to consider the
ethical implications that their actions will have on their users.
Too often I feel that greater open source community (and by extension Dev
Bootcamp) trend toward a sort of money-ocracy: alls well that pays
well. (see: Open Source vs Free Software)</p>
<p>As a kid I quickly learned that the internet was not all game sites and useful
information about how to build paper airplanes. The internet is those things, but
it also a place for viewing pictures of dead soldiers and fornication; for telling
the person who asked you not to swear to fuck off; and for the conspiratorial to
peddle their wares.</p>
<p>This is the internet that nurtured and educated me. The anonymous, pseudonymous,
free-for-all-pretty-for-none bazaar that so captures the varied essence of humanity
and stands in stark contrast to the polished, normalized cleanroom that exists in the
fantasy of advertisers, Supreme Soviet-wannabees, paranoid parents and busybodies.</p>
<p>The idea that we can help shape this future, and preserve it for those who come
next has been “the splinter in my mind”, so to speak. It’s the reason why I’m at
Dev Bootcamp working on this project in the first place. I’m proud to be
working on Quickbits, but I’m more proud to be working with a team of people unafraid
to have the conversation. While there was a clear schism regarding user data and
analytics, we were in agreement on the point: this stuff matters.</p>
