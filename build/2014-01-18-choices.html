<div class="post">
  <p>On Thursday I got the chance to speak with two excellent gentlemen in the software
community: <a href="http://about.me/tundal45">Ashish Dixit</a> and <a href="http://www.coreyhaines.com/">Corey
Haines</a>.</p>
<p>We were at Dev Bootcamp to hear Ashish recount his experience and wisdom learned
in the process of becoming a junior developer at Groupon. For the DBC crowd, it
was illuminating to hear the strategies used by someone (relatively) closer to
our own level of experience.</p>
<p>Afterword, I introduced myself to Corey and Ashish and the three of us
continued along the lines of Ashish’s talk.  My takeaway from that conversation
has been that I need to focus down to one or two key genres/areas/technologies
and work to get <em>good</em> at those things specifically.</p>
<p>I’m anxious about this realization, especially in the concrete form as put by
Corey and Ashish. There are so many things that I want to learn, such that I feel torn
as to which I will want to be doing for the next N months or years.</p>
<p>My limited knowledge touches mainly on the Ruby and JavaScript worlds, and I love
them both.</p>
<p>Which technology — and more importantly: which community — is worth sinking my
limited cycles into?</p>
