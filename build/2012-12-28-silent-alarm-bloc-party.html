            <h2>Silent Alarm - Bloc Party</h2>
<p class="meta">2012-12-28</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>I like to multitask in the shower. It’s my principle thinking space. The
combination of heat and white noise, together with the lack of anything
resembling a device capable of sending or receiving Tweets usually
results in a high “fuck that’s a great a idea!”-to-shower ratio. </p>
<p>I also like listening to music in the shower. This started in middle
school, which is about when I started caring what music I listened to. I
first heard Bloc Party at the recommendation of my pal Ian, who
maintained that it was “the best makeout music” he knew. I never put
that to the test (that I can remember—who knows, maybe I did) but I did
find that it stayed in my shower CD player for longer than just about
any other album save Reel Big Fish’s Cheer Up!</p>
<p>Most people know Bloc Party by now. A Weekend In The City is fantastic,
Intimacy isn’t bad, and Four isn’t that bad either. They’ve been making
music since 2004, and though I hate to say this about any band, their
debut Silent Alarm, is by far their best work.</p>
<p>Silent Alarm works because it sounds like Radiohead’s The Bends meets
Hard-Fi, with a dash of dancepop thrown in to make sure people shake it.
To say the least, Silent Alarm isn’t tough going. </p>
<p>The drums steal the show. They’re tight, fiercely driving, and I would
even say tribal in spots. Kele, now known to a wider audience through
his collaboration with Martin Solveig
(<a href="http://youtu.be/orc9nAiEG_8"><a href="http://youtu.be/orc9nAiEG\_8">http://youtu.be/orc9nAiEG\_8</a></a>), is
brilliant.</p>
<p>Highlights include the raucous opener “Like Eating Glass” and “The
Pioneers”. “Helicopter” is eminently listenable, but picking standouts
on this disc is senseless. It’s a winner fore and aft. Especially if you
listen to it in the shower.</p>
<p>Sounds like: a supposedly good makeout soundtrack?</p>
