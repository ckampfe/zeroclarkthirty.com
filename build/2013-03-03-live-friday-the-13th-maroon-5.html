            <h2>Live Friday The 13th - Maroon 5</h2>
<p class="meta">2013-03-03</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>You might think: “There are three Maroon 5 albums on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArDppihwaWa6dFdaeV9pOXNTeERqbWVFTFp5bWFuNmc&amp;output=html">this
list</a>. What’s
the obsession with tepid adult alternative?”</p>
<p>I would disagree with that assessment. Maroon 5, at least in their early
incarnation, was more than just Top 40 radio hits. I believe that this
is evident in the progression from poppy love songs on “Songs About
Jane” to the shimmery funk on “It Won’t Be Soon Before Long”. “Live:
Friday The 13th” is telling as a stepping stone between the two. You
start see a band that can actually play a live show, and not a bad one
at that.</p>
<p>Of course you can maintain that the live show is mostly about young
females cooing at frontman Adam Levine. This is partially true (and you
can hear it on the record), but listening to “Live” you start to hear a
band that isn’t just playing the album cut. The arrangements are thick,
the groove is tight. “Sweetest Goodbye” more than doubles in length from
its album arrangement to include nasty wah-wah and some star-destroyer
guitar steam. It’s extended 3 minute outro served as the inspiration for
our own high school Battle of the Bands outro.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s girly. Yeah, it’s poppy. But Maroon 5 can get a jam on, too.</p>
<p>Sounds like: surprising</p>
