<div class="post">
  <p>Warm morning sun. Showing up to class late, the headphones taking
caffeine’s place. That’s this album.</p>
<p>3 Autumns ago. Complex to Confer-Vickner in 3 minutes
(<a href="https://gustavus.edu/about/maps/"><a href="https://gustavus.edu/about/maps/">https://gustavus.edu/about/maps/</a></a>).</p>
<p>I was late so often that I got a D in “class participation”, despite
being the only one who read or talked. I didn’t sleep much in those
days. I taught myself to use a camera during all those late nights,
which got me a job at The Gustavian Weekly. The books, I think, have
crept back into the black.</p>
<p>The class was for my major, and yet, all I can remember is As Tall As
Lions’ “Love, Love, Love (Love Love)”, “Ghost of New York”, “Song for
Luna”, and “Stab City”.</p>
<p>I’m sure that there was a point to all this, but I only remember waking
up with As Tall As Lions.</p>
<p>Sounds like: the cure for being chronically underslept</p>
