<div class="post">
  <p>I don’t even remember how I found this album. Then again, that could be
the MSG talking. I’m sitting here, eating a crepe, and I feel like I’ve
been drugged.</p>
<p>I would compare this album favorably with anything from The Format or
Copeland. It’s that same playful, sparkling indie-pop. If that isn’t
your thing, I would bet 100 dollars (American) that you will not like
this album. The vocals will annoy you.</p>
<p>But I like it. And, seeing as this is my list, and not yours, asshole,
I’m going to proceed with my prepared remarks.</p>
<p>I do remember roughly when I found this album. It was last year. It was
Senior year. At the house known affectionately as “The Nightmare” (or
“The Briar Patch”, if you’re a real OG).</p>
<p>This album was a favorite of mine for probably 3 weeks. Every day I
would wake up before class or work and death-march to the shower with my
laptop. I would open my laptop, and I would play this album. I would
then proceed to sing along with this album until I realized I was going
to be late for whatever function I needed to attend. It went like this
for weeks, and the album never lost its novelty. The cooing and
male-female duet vocals were soothing for some reason.</p>
<p>I also credit this album for really helping me open up to singing. I
love singing, but I’m shit at it. This album was like permission to sing
along. Plus, everyone sounds better in the shower.</p>
<p>Sounds like: waking up on a chilly day in warm covers</p>
<p>I can’t find a single track from this album on Youtube, so I got you the
next best thing:</p>
