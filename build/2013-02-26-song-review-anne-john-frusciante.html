            <h2>Song Review - Anne - John Frusciante</h2>
<p class="meta">2013-02-26</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame is also something of a
prolific little bugger even when not on company time.</p>
<p>He has produced…I don’t know how many solo albums. So what if most of
them are noodly fiddling? There are upsides to almost everything (except
Butter Burgers, in which case the inverse is true: there is no
downside).</p>
<p>From his album Curtains, “Anne” is something of an oddity. Bars of 6/8
alternate with standard time, and there really isn’t much more than a
man and his guitar, often spaced out with a liberal degree of isolation.</p>
<p>The real money of the track - the zenith - starts to hit you at 1:36 of
the way in to a 3:35 song. I think I overspoke. It isn’t the zenith, or
loudest part of the song by any stretch, as electric guitar enters a bit
later to lend a bit of pepper, but the caesura and break at 1:36 so
compelled me on first listen that I kept the track on repeat and
couldn’t even make it to the end most of the time.</p>
<p>Like so many other great songs, that moment of clarity when it rounds
the corner cries out for enjoyment. The killer riff to kick into the
meat of Van Halen’s “Panama” or the thundering 8th note tom-toms leading
into M83’s “Steve McQueen” are other examples. Despite being the shy kid
of the bunch, Frusciante’s “Anne” captivates.</p>
<p>Sounds like: summer camp, for some reason</p>
