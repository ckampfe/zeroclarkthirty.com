            <h2>Fortress - Protest The Hero</h2>

  <p>This album crushes. Right off the bat, you get slapped around by
“Bloodmeat”. It doesn’t really stop, either. The double-whammy of
“Goddess Bound” and “Goddess Gagged” is one of the strongest finishes to
an album I know.</p>
<p>My buddy Joey introduced me to the track “Sequoia Throne”, and I’m glad
he did. Call it mathcore, metalcore, metal, whatever. It bangs HARD.
Kick drum rolls, furious fretboard calisthenics, off-kilter time
signatures, this song has it all.</p>
<p>“Sequoia Throne” is also particularly noteworthy for the vocal skill on
display by screamer-in-chief Rody Walker. This guy can yelp, scream,
bellow, and then croon like a canary on top of it all. I’m not sure
where he got his vocal chords, but they’ve gotta be custom.</p>
<p>If you examine the cover of this delightful children’s record, you’ll
certainly get the pagan/sacrificial lambs/wearing-of-deer-hides vibe.
Maybe the metal-y music + cult behavior trope is a little played out,
but I’ve never heard it done better than this. Protest The Hero approach
it so fully and with such sincerity that Fortress is a privileged
listen. The bass player, Arif Mirabdolbaghi, says it like this: “[The
theme] can be more appreciated by more people. If I had to reduce it to
its simplest form, the concept is about the re-emerging of goddess
worship and the erosion of faith in scientific process.”</p>
<p>With a healthy dose of goddess worship and sincerity in shredding,
what’s not to like? Really though, do yourself a favor and check out
Fortress. If nothing else, you’ll learn that you’re a pansy who can’t
abide punishing Canadian mathcore.</p>
<p>Sounds like: rams’ heads and virgin bloodletting.</p>
