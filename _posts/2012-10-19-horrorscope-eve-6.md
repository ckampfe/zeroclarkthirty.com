Horrorscope - Eve 6
===================

This is a high school summers album. I can remember cruising around in
my buddy Calvin’s car banging this album loud as fuck.

Everyone knows the dopey single “Here’s to the Night”. What they don’t
know is that the rest of this album sounds nothing like the single.
Record companies do strange things.

When I think of this album, I think of bonfires, pool parties and
playing ultimate frisbee at 12am under stadium lights. And humidity. But
I try not to think about humidity.

Sounds like: poppy Van Halen.
