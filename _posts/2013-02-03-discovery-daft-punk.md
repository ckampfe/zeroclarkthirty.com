Let’s be real—there are maybe four songs anyone actually listens to on
this album: One More Time, Harder Better Faster Stronger, Too Long, and
the one that matters, Digital Love.

Anyone who knows me knows that I am not religious.

That said, I have a profound relationship with the song Digital Love.
This series of album recollections
([Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArDppihwaWa6dFdaeV9pOXNTeERqbWVFTFp5bWFuNmc&output=html))
has been nothing if not a shameless exercise in solipsistic memory
association, and Digital Love is, I’m proud to say, no different.

I would play Digital Love every time I crested the St. Peter city limits
after returning to college from a holiday or break in Omaha.

I don’t have synesthesia, but I sometimes wish I did. This song feels
like optimism. It feels like a different kind of home. My time at
Gustavus was complicated - as I’m sure was everyone’s - and despite the
negativity I sometimes feel about the place, this song has the power to
make me smile every single damn time I emerge from the tunnel of trees
on Highway 169. Thank you, Gustavus.

Sounds like: Subaru, windows down, stereo up, St. Peter, smile.
