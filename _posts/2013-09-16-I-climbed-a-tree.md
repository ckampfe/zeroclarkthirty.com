As most of my recent entries have taken the form of a response to some other post, let me continue this trend.

My response this time is to David Byttow's post from earlier this summer, called ["Always Be Coding: How to Land an Engineering Job"](https://medium.com/tech-talk/d5f8051afce2).  I read the post in July, but my head was not where it is now. Dev Bootcamp's [Dave Hoover](https://twitter.com/davehoover) tweeted it just a few days ago, and the timing could not have been better. 

Having just finished my Phase 0 Ruby assessment, I've now just about a month until class starts. I'm pretty excited, and in a [previous post](http://zeroclarkthirty.com/2013/08/28/dbc-assessment-now.html) I detailed my intention to make sure that I will not allow any stasis to take place between now and then . This time for me is, I think, quite valuable.

Considering my prior thoughts in this regard, ABC: Always Be Coding reappared just as I have been scouring the landscape for more mental ammunition. The part that stood out for me was Byttow's quote of Eric Schmidt, saying, "Repitition doesn't spoil the prayer."

Taking this, I looked at the rest of the piece; what could I practice? Byttow lists a number of suggestions, particularly the passages regarding word problems, data structures, and common algorithms. These are things that I have always found interesting (or at least, the idea of them, being largely ignorant as to their specifics), but have never known where to start. Well, that's over. I know where to start. 

And I have started. Since re-reading this piece a few days ago, I've been reading and writing code nearly nonstop. Aside from my work on (Flashcalcjs)[https://github.com/ckampfe/flashcalcjs](it works!), I've been inspired to take a look at sorting algorithms. An excellent series from (Computerphile)[https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile] on sorting was both informative and fun, so I jumped in that direction. You can see my progress so far (here)[https://github.com/ckampfe/sorts]. 

Maybe this type of thing is droll to those with more established theoretical foundations, but as someone whose background in science begins with "political" rather than "computer", I find it novel and thrilling.
