title: Your Favorite Weapon - Brand New
date: 2013-02-03
---

I first heard this album on a bus somewhere in the vicinity of
Adventureland, in the middle of Iowa. It was, I believe, 8th grade. Neil
Orians spun the disc, and I was hooked. It’s a fitting relationship,
because “Your Favorite Weapon” is mostly whiny high-school emo-punk. 

It’s the kind of album you grow out of, and I would say rightly so. It
applies extraordinarily well to that middle-school/high-school period,
and less so thereafter. 

But who cares about that? It was fucking great at the time. It resonated
then for me as few albums do now. I still throw it on every once in
awhile, and I’m not the least bit embarrassed.

Sounds like: A bus somewhere in Iowa.
