Shit, the code probably isn't even right (still haven't done that much with objects), but you get the idea. 

{% highlight ruby %}
class Boot
  def excited()
    excitement = 1
    while true 
      excitement += 1     
    end
  end
end

clark = Boot.new() 
clark.excited()

{% endhighlight %}

Yes, you're right, it's an infinite loop. That's the point :)
