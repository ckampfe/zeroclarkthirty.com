Instead of one monolithic reflection on Dev Bootcamp
delivered in a single 10,000 word explosion, it seems that my reflections are
starting to come to me in a more piecemeal fashion.

This one is about my feelings and perceptions not even 3 weeks out from graduating.

I feel lucky. I've had to good fortune to be lumped in with an amazing group
of people. An amazing community. I've made friends, not just "connections".

I feel prepared, but realistic. I know that I am green as hell. I know that
every employer out there will immediately realize that.
I know that a fair few established developers I meet will mock or
snicker at my friends and I.  I fully anticipate being rejected out of hand
by >85% of the firms I apply with.

This, again, is just how it goes. Therefore, I'm trying to focus my emotional energy
elsewhere: reinforcing previous topics and learning about new ones.

And this something of the problem, coming out of DBC. There are so many things
that I don't yet know, but feel I am now capable of learning with some dedicated
effort. And I'm having the damnedest time focusing on one thing at a time.
Here's a little list (unordered) of topics I'm keen on:

- getting good at testing (BDD, RSpec, Cucumber, etc)
- C
- functional JavaScript
- an internal tool for my brother
- Scheme
- Node
- a Rails or Sinatra app for reinforcement
- a publish/subscribe Ruby chat app using sockets
- another WebRTC project
- Websockets
- Processing
- Python
- a JVM language (Scala, Clojure, etc; not Java)
- finish a course on encryption theory
- more algorithm/data structure construction (sorts, trees, graphs, etc.)

Right now I'm pushing myself hard in the direction of RSpec and BDD, and then
using that to build a chat app, But I find myself going down rabbit holes
whenever I open my computer: "Oh man! Python is the place to be/wouldn't Clojure
be neat?/I need to focus on JS/C would be fun!/I need more algorithm && data
structure practice." And I end up *reading about* something for 4 hours without
actually doing it.

This has been ravaging my productivity lately, and I hate it. If anybody has any
suggestions as to how to manage this sort of feeling, or any tips about which
things to prioritize given my skill and situation (green and jobless), I'd
absolutely be receptive to that conversation.
