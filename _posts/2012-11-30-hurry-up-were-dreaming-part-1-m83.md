title: Hurry Up, Were Dreaming Part 1 - M83
date: 2012-11-30

To me, this album is, in a word, perfect.

Let’s talk emotional impact. Every album I’ll cover or have covered in
this project
([](http://clarkkampfe.tumblr.com/album_love)[http://clarkkampfe.tumblr.com/album\_love](http://clarkkampfe.tumblr.com/album_love))
has caused my brain to have a positive chemical reaction at one time or
another, that much is true. But this is an album apart.

I have never heard anything like this. I have seldom seen a photograph,
or a movie, or read a book that has made me feel like this album can
make me feel. (The only album that comes close to this one is Mew’s
“Frengers”, which will be reviewed another time.)

When I first heard M83’s “Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming”, I lay down on my
bed and smiled and cried. Despite repeat listens, I still have this
reaction. What else do you need to know?

Sounds like: sun’s gentle caress through the window, playing
hide-and-seek, a chilly fall day, first kisses, high school football
games, gentle hands through my hair, childhood’s bittersweet triumphant
swan song.
