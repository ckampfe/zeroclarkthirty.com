Not much to this one. It kind of says it all when three of the tracks
are called “Suicide X” (where X is 1, 2, or 3) and one is called
“Decisions”. Piano, falsetto, reverb, and sadness. Oh yeah and some
strings. 

Some people have called this album R&B. I’m not so sure about that. If
that’s true, then the standard for R&B is pretty fucking loose: falsetto
male vocals. This means Thom Yorke is R&B. Count me among the nay votes
on that matter.

Occasionally an otherwise unremarkable album will hit you at an
especially poignant time. This is one of those albums. 


Sounds like: Being alone.
