<p>This album comes from an interesting time in my life. I remember spending an inhumane amount of time on the net, second only to perhaps the amount I spend here in the present. It was an era of discovery. I remember that Pitchfork was still something of a new, hot thing, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oink%27s_Pink_Palace" target="_blank">OiNK&#8217;s Pink Palace</a> was roaring along with glee.

</p><p>Of the two Mew albums I know well and love dearly, this was the first. This was the introduction (with &#8220;Frengers" being the other) to the bizarre Danish shoegaze progstonauts called Mew.</p>

<p>I was a big frequenter of music blogs at this point, and somewhere I remember reading someone refer to And The Glass Handed Kites as &#8220;Cocteau Twins freaks Sonic Youth", or something like that. I never really got into Sonic Youth, but holy shit can you hear the Cocteau Twins on this one.</p>

<p>This album is influential to me for more than just its serving as my vector, my mis en scene, if you will, into Frengers. It was also the first time I can remember discovering a song so breathtaking, so pants-shittingly awesome, that I just kept it on repeat for hours on end.</p>

<p>That song is called &#8220;Special", and it is. I still has the best start to a chorus of all time. That feeling you get when they hit it, and he cries, &#8220;I know what you said to me&#8230;" is fucking it. Turn it up loud and don&#8217;t take my word for it.</p>

<p> This album was also part of a brief proggy foray I took at that time, with bands like The Mars Volta, At the Drive In, Bryan Scary and The Shredding Tears, The Sound of Animals Fighting, and Battles. It really seemed like neo-prog was the thing back then (somehow I missed out on The Fucking Champs metaling it up). Now we have Fang Island the newer M83 stuff, which is fucking great. What a rich genre.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve left the point somewhere on the side of the road, but go on and see if you can handle musical genius cocktail 1-part Denmark, 1-part shoegaze, 1-part spaceprog.</p>
