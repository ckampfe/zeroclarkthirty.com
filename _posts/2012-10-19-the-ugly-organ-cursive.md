The Ugly Organ - Cursive
========================

I have a soft spot in my heart for Cursive, being a fellow flatlander
and all. 

That being said, this album isn’t easy. “The Recluse” was big on the
radio for a while, but that’s about where the radio-friendliness ends. 

Start at “A Gentleman Caller” and stick around until “Staying Alive” and
you’ll be treated to your fair share of yelps. I love “Sierra” and “Art
is Hard”.

The Ugly Organ is the last Cursive album to feature the cello skills of
Gretta Cohn, and they really help. The cello lends a sense of mystery,
helping this album seem like the accompaniment to a film noir or horror
flick. 

This album came out when I was in 7th grade, but I remember discovering
it a few years later in high school. Though I don’t listen to it much
anymore, I still enjoy it and credit it as being my introduction to
Cursive.

Sounds like: The half-time music at a bizarro flea market.
