title: Hold Your Color - Pendulum
date: 2012-11-15

I can say with a good deal of confidence that my hearing has been
diminished due to Pendulum’s Hold Your Colour. I found this doozy
sometime ago on OiNK, probably on the Top 10 or a Staff Pick, and just
rolled from there. Calvin and I use to cruise around attempting to
destroy his subwoofer with this jam, and that sub HAS to be worse for
it. \
\
The intro is fucking goofy. It’s a disembodied voice reading some goofy
Carl Sagan-type shit. You might get goosebumps, you might laugh, but it
will get your attention. I’m putting it here in its entirety just so you
can read it and get an idea of where this is going: “Somewhere out there
in the vast nothingness of space…somewhere far away in space and
time…staring upward at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky…were
marooned on a small island…in an endless sea…confined to a tiny spit of
sand…unable to escape…but tonight…on this small planet…on earth…we’re
going to rock civilization”.\
\
That’s how the albums starts. Forgive Pendulum for that indulgence, if
you would. The next track is worth it. “Slam”, which is without question
one of the loudest, hardest hitting bangers of the 2000-2010 decade,
rocks like something possessed. “That’s all I have to say about that,”
Forrest Gump said.\
\
My personal highlights include “Plasticworld”, the title track “Hold
Your Colour”, and “Sounds of Life”. \
\
Some would say this is a good stepping stone to better DnB. For some
reason, this album has attracted a lot of hate. Maybe people see
Pendulum as the Skrillex of DnB. Mass appeal, not especially
“challenging” in terms of musicality, easy to get one’s ass moving. I’m
not sure these traits are bad if the underlying musical soul is genuine.
I feel that this is the case for Hold Your Colour. Personally, Pendulum
is how I found a lot of the great stuff on Hospital Records, like Danny
Byrd (who I also love). \
\
It’s true that the formula on Hold Your Colour isn’t especially
complicated, but why should that matter? Lots of Amen break, fatty
screaming leads, lush pads you could nap on, and headache inducing bass.
Sure, it’s been done before elsewhere. For this record, taken as a
whole, I believe you’ll find yourself thinking: is that so wrong?\

Sounds like: The last party on a dying moon colony.\
