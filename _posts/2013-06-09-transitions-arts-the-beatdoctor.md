There are albums to lay in bed to, there are albums to get in bed to,
there are albums to run to, there are albums to rage to.

In the simplest terms, Arts The Beatdoctor’s “Transitions” is the “night
driving” album par excellence.

Put me in the driver’s seat, with a 5-speed in my hand and a cutie in
the seat beside me, throw this bad boy on the stereo and I’ll drive us
across the state.

I don’t want to call it soothing, but it’s in that realm. Not some
soft-rock bullshit, but more like ringing cymbals, tasty running
basslines and bouncy electric piano. Somewhat like a less happy, more
electronic [Percy
Hill](http://zeroclarkthirty.com/2012/10/21/after-all-percy-hill.html).
Jazz-hop, I’ll call it. And it really is both. There are a few nice
verses, and plenty (really, a good deal) of jazz influences on this. You
don’t make a record like this without knowing the good stuff.

I would be shocked if there isn’t a night driving sequence in some film
or a car commercial out there that has used songs from this album; I
find its character to be that blatant.

Sounds like: shadows from highway lights
