# About me

I am user-focused technologist. I believe that the greatest optimization is a greater understanding of the user and the problem domain. I take pride in my ability to research a topic deeply and present what I have learned in a useful manner to an audience, whether as a writeup, a talk, or a working implementation on which to build.

<br />

# Employment

- Gamut, Fall 2016 - Present ;; <em>Data Engineer</em>
- Belly, Spring 2014 - Summer 2016 ;; <em>Data Engineer</em>
- Tunisia Live, Fall 2012 - Spring 2013 ;; <em>Photojournalist</em>

<br />

# Selected Projects

- Purchase prediction markov model ;; <em>Spark, Scala</em>
<br />
<br />
At Gamut, completely revamped an untested, slow, non-scalable product recommendation system. 
Went from ball-of-mud Python/Perl/VBA to Scala/Spark, taking runtime from 4 days to 3 hours and greatly improved the future maintainability and iteration time. Taught other engineers about Spark and functional programming.
<br />
<br />
- Build/optimize implementation of ETF binary protocol ;; <em>Clojurescript</em>
<br />
<br />
A side project to learn more about the tradeoffs of binary protocols and optimization in the browser. Took naive slow, naive implementation to a version that benchmarks competitively with JSON engines. Wrote a notebook-style retrospective of my findings: http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=ckampfe&repo=birdie&path=birdie.clj
<br />
<br />
- Data pipeline coordination system ;; <em>Clojure, AWS SQS, AWS Redshift</em>
<br />
<br />
At Gamut, built the first version of ETL system to move data from multiple relational databases into an Amazon S3 data lake, and then in to Amazon Redshift for analyst end-users. Helped wire up frontend and socialize access to analytical data to the rest of the company.
<br />
<br />
- Heartbeat event ingestion system ;; Scala, Ruby, RabbitMQ, Apache Flume, Amazon S3
<br />
<br />
At Belly, built a system to ingest and store "phone home" messages from a fleet of field-deployed hardware. System handled steady load and was resilient when faced with an S3 outage.
<br />
<br />
- Performance optimization of copy-generation system  ;; <em>Clojure, Elixir</em>
<br />
<br />
At Gamut, identified hotspots and inefficient implementation in a system that generated product copy for an ecommerce website. Developed a simple frontend to allow end-users to use the service on their own.
<br />
<br />
- Programmatic data pipeline generation system ;; <em>Scala, misc. AWS</em>
<br />
<br />
At Belly, built the company's ETL coordination system to move data from relational stores to S3 and Redshift. Was able to transparently adapt to the addition of new sources.
