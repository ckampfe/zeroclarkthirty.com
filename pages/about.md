# Hi, I'm Clark!

When I'm not fighting villainy and leaping tall buildings, I like to ride my bike, take pictures, and learn all I can about web development. A few of my interests are: Middle East politics, cyber and national security, free software, film, music, and photojournalism. I'd love to hear from you!
